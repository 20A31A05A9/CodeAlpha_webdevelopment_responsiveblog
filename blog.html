                <p> Engineering uses science, math, and technology to solve challenges. From civil engineers who create
                    optimal layouts for cities to software engineers who develop our favorite apps, engineers power much
                    of the world around us and fuel technological innovation.

                    There are multiple types of engineering, including:

                    Mechanical engineering: the design and development of heavy machinery and its components.

                    Electrical engineering: the use of electricity to power computerized devices and digital systems.

                    Civil engineering: the creation and maintenance of infrastructure like roads, tunnels, public
                    transit systems, and more.

                    Software engineering: the application of engineering principles to create computer or web
                    applications.

                    Computer engineering: the building and maintenance of computer hardware and connected systems.

                    Aerospace engineering: the use of aerodynamics principles to design aircraft and related systems.

                    Chemical engineering: the study and use of raw chemicals.

                    Environmental engineering: the practice of improving sustainability and reducing pollution in the
                    natural world.

                    Biomedical engineering: the creation of equipment and systems for improving human health.

                    Engineers in every specialization need strong problem-solving abilities and working knowledge of
                    system design, project management, and computer science. Whether you lean toward creativity or
                    logical analysis, engineering can engage your mind and challenge you professionally.</p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    People around the world use and interact with physical and digital structures every day. An online
                    engineering degree equips you to plan, develop and craft the structures that make life safer and
                    more efficient.

                    Engineering applies math and science principles to creatively solve problems across countless
                    industries. Most engineering jobs require a relevant bachelor’s degree in the field, and online
                    engineering programs allow you to fulfill this requirement from the comfort of your home—and often
                    on your own schedule.

                    This guide explores online engineering degrees in digital, structural and electrical subfields,
                    listing all nine schools in the U.S. that meet our ranking criteria and offer online engineering
                    bachelor’s programs. Read on to learn about common coursework, tuition costs, degree timelines and
                    learning methods for an online engineering bachelor’s.
